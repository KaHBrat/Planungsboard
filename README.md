A student's project to manage dev teams and project lead teams

## Motivation

To organize projects with multiple dev and it project lead teams we created a physically 'Planungsboard'. To enable the collaborative work on this board we want to create a small application.

A consideration was done if we want use existing tools or buy a product. Both didn't match our expectations.
